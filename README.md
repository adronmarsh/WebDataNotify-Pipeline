## Overview

WebDataNotify Pipeline is designed to automate the monitoring of product information on JD Sports. It employs dynamic web scraping to extract key product details, utilizes Kafka for efficient data streaming, and integrates an email notification system for timely updates.

## Features

- **Dynamic Web Scraping:** Utilizes BeautifulSoup for dynamic web scraping, extracting product details such as title, link, available colors, price, and specific links to product pages.

- **Kafka Data Streaming:** Implements Apache Kafka for efficient data streaming, transforming product details into JSON format and sending them to a Kafka topic for distributed processing.

- **Data Pipeline:** Builds a robust data pipeline using Kafka, ensuring effective management of information flow from scraping to email notification.
